## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Vue.js 3 Composition API Structure:
```javascript
// New reactive data added:
const showViewModal = ref(false)
const viewingInvoice = ref(null)
const editingInvoice = ref(null)

// New functions added:
const viewInvoice(invoice)
const closeViewModal()
const editInvoice(invoice)
const downloadPdf(invoice)
const emailPdf(invoice)
const printInvoice(invoice)
const generatePrintableInvoice(invoice)
const getCustomerEmail(invoice)
const getCustomerPhone(invoice)
const formatDate(dateString)
```

### Enhanced Action Buttons:
```html
<!-- PDF Download -->
<button @click="downloadPdf(invoice)" class="btn-info-small">
  <svg><!-- Download icon --></svg>
  PDF
</button>

<!-- Email PDF -->  
<button @click="emailPdf(invoice)" class="btn-warning-small">
  <svg><!-- Email icon --></svg>
  Email
</button>

<!-- Print -->
<button @click="printInvoice(invoice)" class="btn-success-small">
  <svg><!-- Print icon --></svg>
  Print  
</button>

<!-- View Details -->
<button @click="viewInvoice(invoice)" class="btn-primary-small">
  <svg><!-- Eye icon --></svg>
  View
</button>

<!-- Edit -->
<button @click="editInvoice(invoice)" class="btn-secondary-small">

</button>

<!-- Delete -->
<button @click="deleteInvoice(invoice.id)" class="btn-danger-small">
  <svg><!-- Trash icon --></svg>

```

## 🏗️ Backend Integration

### Required Laravel Endpoints:
```php
// InvoiceController methods needed:
GET  /api/invoices/{id}/pdf     - Generate PDF download
POST /api/invoices/{id}/email   - Email PDF to customer  
PUT  /api/invoices/{id}         - Update invoice
DELETE /api/invoices/{id}       - Delete invoice
```

### PDF Generation (Backend Implementation Needed):
```php
public function downloadPdf($id) {
    $invoice = Invoice::with('invoiceable')->findOrFail($id);
    $pdf = PDF::loadView('invoices.pdf', compact('invoice'));
    return $pdf->download("invoice-{$invoice->invoice_number}.pdf");
}

public function emailPdf($id) {
    $invoice = Invoice::with('invoiceable')->findOrFail($id);
    // Email logic implementation
    return response()->json(['message' => 'PDF emailed successfully']);
}
```
